    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Background\n",
    "SyriaTel is a major telecommunications company operating in a competitive and evolving mobile service industry. Like many telecom companies, SyriaTel faces the ongoing challenge of customer churn — the phenomenon where customers discontinue their subscriptions or switch to competitors. High churn rates can significantly reduce profitability, especially in markets where acquiring new customers is more costly than retaining existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, SyriaTel has collected data on its customer base, including usage patterns, demographic attributes, service subscriptions, and customer support interactions. The objective of this project is to build a **machine learning classification model** that can accurately **predict whether a customer is likely to churn** in the near future. With this insight, SyriaTel can proactively take steps to retain customers at risk of leaving.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Objective\n",
    "The main goal is to **reduce customer churn** by:\n",
    "- Identifying customers most at risk of leaving.\n",
    "- Understanding the **key drivers** or reasons behind churn behavior.\n",
    "- Enabling SyriaTel’s **Customer Retention Team** to take **targeted actions** like personalized offers, loyalty programs, or improved service quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model serves as a **decision support tool** to optimize customer engagement strategies, reduce revenue loss, and improve customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stakeholders\n",
    "1. **Customer Retention Team** – to design and execute proactive retention campaigns.\n",
    "2. **Marketing Department** – to develop data-driven promotions or loyalty incentives.\n",
    "3. **Customer Service Team** – to prioritize high-risk customers for support interventions.\n",
    "4. **Product Development Team** – to gain insight into what service features influence customer satisfaction.\n",
    "5. **Executive Leadership** – to understand customer lifetime value and strategic revenue impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Business Questions\n",
    "- Can we predict which customers are likely to churn based on historical data?\n",
    "- What are the **most important factors** influencing customer churn?\n",
    "- How can we **reduce churn rates** using actionable insights from the model?\n",
    "- Which customer segments are most vulnerable to churn, and how should they be addressed differently?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Business Value\n",
    "- **Revenue Preservation**: Preventing churn is generally more cost-effective than acquiring new customers.\n",
    "- **Customer Satisfaction**: Targeted intervention improves brand perception and loyalty.\n",
    "- **Operational Efficiency**: Helps prioritize resources (e.g., call center time, retention campaigns) where they are most needed.\n",
    "- **Strategic Planning**: Provides leadership with predictive analytics to guide business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Criteria\n",
    "- A **classification model** with acceptable performance metrics (e.g., F1-score, precision, recall) especially for the **churn class**.\n",
    "- Business interpretability through **feature importance** to guide actionable strategies.\n",
    "- Presentation of insights in a format understandable to non-technical stakeholders.\n",
